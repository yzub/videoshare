Building a completely serverless video sharing website, complete with:

 - User authentication
 - Large file video uploads
 - A transcoding pipeline, that transcodes uploaded videos to web-friendly 480p mp4 format
 - Push-based, event-driven updates to the web-site. Users see new videos automatically, no browser refreshes needed
 - The ability to play video files hosted on scalable cloud storage.
